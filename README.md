# Biased_pigeons

The `Teaching_resources` folder contains the hungry and satiated priming texts embedded in the complete email we sent to students. The pigeon video students were provided with to estimate foraging behaviour can also be found in this folder.

We use a webpage to present our supplementary material. It can be viewed [here](https://tomkeaney.github.io/Biased_pigeons/). Our analysis, including the raw data and complete code is included.
