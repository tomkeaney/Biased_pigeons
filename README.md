# Biased_pigeons

The `Teaching_resources` folder contains the hungry and satiated priming texts embedded in the complete email we sent to students. The pigeon video students were provided with to estimate foraging behaviour can also be found in this folder.

In association with the mauncript {paper name}, published in _Animal Behaviour_, we use a webpage to present a detailed rationale of our modelling approach, and a walkthrough of our code. It can be viewed [here](https://tomkeaney.github.io/Biased_pigeons/).
